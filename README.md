# RespectMyEyes light theme for VS Code

Probably the better light theme **for Frontend (React + JS/TS + CSS + HTML)** for VS Code!  

The author was annoyed by the available ones.  

It's still WIP (work in progress).

## Supported languages

The author concentrates on the **Frontend** (primarily React, TypeScript, CSS, HTML) and **.NET** ecosystems.  
Other ecosystems can be added if people want them.  ...And if you contribute the initial development for these languages.



FrontEnd ecosystem:

To use multiple themes for specific file types - look at [Theme by language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsaulou.theme-by-language).



## What's next?

A lot can be improved. However, I don't have much time to dedicate to ecosystems I don't actually use. My stack is TS + React, .NET Core + ASP.NET Core + PowerShell.  

I would very much welcome contributions to other ecosystems, and to the provided ones also.



## Instructions for dev

Press F5 to launch an Extension Development Host window.  
Changes to the theme file are applied live in the Extension Development Host window.  

"npm run build-and-install" to package the theme from source, and to install into VS Code. Requires VS Code reload.
