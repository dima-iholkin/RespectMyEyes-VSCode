The regression testing is the easily available **basic** testing of the latest changes.  
Exploration testing is still required.  

Probably many of these 300 files can be removed, as they duplicate a lot.  
The new found cases should be added to the regression testing suite.

I should keep tabs on how much each file in the test suite helps. So to reduce their number.
